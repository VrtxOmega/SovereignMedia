## Ecosystem Canon

Sovereign Media Mobile was the Android extension of the VERITAS & Sovereign Ecosystem's media management layer — a React Native client that sync'd audiobook and video libraries from the desktop Sovereign Media Electron app via a local WebSocket bridge. It ran a bifurcated storage engine (transient buffer + permanent vault) and was designed for zero-cloud, zero-subscription offline media consumption. The mobile extension has been absorbed into the parent project to unify the deployment surface.

## What It Was

An Android media player providing:

- Audiobook and eBook library synced from desktop Sovereign Media
- Local-only storage — no cloud dependency
- WebSocket-based sync over local network
- Playback position persistence
- Offline-first architecture with encrypted persistent vault

---

## Migration Path

The full source code and build configuration are now maintained as a `mobile/` subdirectory in [SovereignMedia](https://github.com/VrtxOmega/SovereignMedia/tree/main/mobile).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VrtxOmega/SovereignMedia.git
cd SovereignMedia/mobile
# See README.md in that directory for build instructions
```
